Problem background:

We have created a simple .Net Core application that currently consists of one page that is used to capture firstname, lastname and comment.
 
The application is partially implemented but there is currently no data/persistence layer implemented. 
There are currently 4 unit tests, 3 of which are passing and 1 is failing (Repository test).

Prerequisites:

1)	Download and unzip the zip file called “CustomerFeedbackAppCandidate” and unzip it to a folder located in “C:\ CustomerFeedbackApp”
2)	Have a copy of Visual Studio 2019 available to use
3)	Have an Azure subscription available to use to for the data persistence implementation.

Solution and what you need to do:

1)	You need to get the failing repository test passing by implementing the business logic to save the feedback data to a persistence layer implementation of your choice. (You may choose, Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB etc.)
2)	You will need to deploy your application to Azure. (how you do this is your call).
3)	As an extra you may wish to create new functionality that shows the overall sentiment of all feedback, you may choose to extend the existing solution or create a new solution. (How you do this is up to you but you may look at something like sentiment analysis using Azure Text Analytics).

Timescale:

You will have approx 3 days to implement your solution, after which you will have to send your zipped solution to mclarke@lqgroup.org.uk. All solutions will be assessed and you may be asked if you wish to attend a final face-to-face (Teams) interview.
